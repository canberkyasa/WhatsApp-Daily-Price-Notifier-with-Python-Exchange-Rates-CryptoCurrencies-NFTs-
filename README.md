# WhatsApp Daily Price Notifier with Python (Exchange Rates, CryptoCurrencies & NFTs)
This code helps to track the current exchange rates, cryptocurrencies and the current value of NFTs by sending them as whatsapp messages

The code retrieves cryptocurrency data from CoinGeckoAPI, NFT data from CoinGeckoAPI, and exchange rates from altin.in. 
It then sends a WhatsApp message containing today's exchange rates, cryptocurrency prices, and NFT information using the pywhatkit library.

Note:
- Ensure necessary libraries are installed by running 'pip install [package]' if required.
- Make sure to replace the phone number and name variables with the appropriate values before running the script.
- The script uses APIs to retrieve cryptocurrency and NFT data, and web scraping to get exchange rates. Ensure stable internet connectivity for successful execution.
